# Doubly Linked Lists

## Terms & Notes

- Doubly linked list: almost identical to singly linked lists, except every node has another pointer to the previous node
- Has a **head** and **tail**, every **node** points to the node in front of it and behind it
- Takes up more memory, but you get more flexibility
