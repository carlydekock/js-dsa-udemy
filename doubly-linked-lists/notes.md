# Doubly Linked Lists

## Terms & Notes

- Doubly linked list: almost identical to singly linked lists, except every node has another pointer to the previous node
- Has a **head** and **tail**, every **node** points to the node in front of it and behind it
- Takes up more memory, but you get more flexibility

## Big O

- Insertion: O(1)
- Removal: O(1)
  - This is better than for a singly linked list.
- Searching: O(N)
  - Technically, searching is O(N/2) but that's still O(N)
- Access: O(N)
