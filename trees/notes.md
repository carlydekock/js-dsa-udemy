## Use Cases for Trees

- HTML DOM (Document Object Model)
- Network Routing
- Abstract Syntax Trees (describing syntax of a programming language)
- Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (decision tree)
- Folders in operating systems
- Parsed JSON data has a tree structure

## Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

- Every parent node has at most two children
- Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
- Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent
- BSTs are used to sort data that can be compared and is sortable
- BSTs are very efficient for searching and inserting

## Binary Trees

- Each node can have at most two children
